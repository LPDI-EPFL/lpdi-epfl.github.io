# Abstract

A docking-and-alignment protocol was devised in order to build amyloid protofilaments of Transthyretin (TTR), starting from partially disrupted TTR monomeric subunits and based on experimentally available information. The docking approach is driven by a combination of shape complementarity and energetic criteria, and uses constraints derived from experimental data obtained for the fibrillar state. The dimeric structures obtained were then subjected to an alignment scheme followed by clustering analysis, producing a collection of protofilaments with distinct geometric properties. The selected protofilament model presented here does agree with known experimental data and general amyloid properties; it is formed by two extended continuous beta-sheets with the beta-strands perpendicular to the main axis of the protofilament and a helical twist with a period of approximately 48 beta-strands. This TTR proto-filament model may be an important step in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of TTR aggregation, as well as, a valuable instrument in drug design strategies against amyloid diseases.
