Sensing and accurately quantifying small molecules in biological samples remains an unmet challenge in many areas related to health and biotechnology. While very promising sensing platforms have been developed, the limitation remains in the ability of designing high affinity and specific small molecule receptors that can be used in these sensing platforms. To accomplish this project our laboratory will approach this problem using both chemical biology and computational protein design approaches.
