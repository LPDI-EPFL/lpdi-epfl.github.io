Protein-based drugs (biologics) are one of the fastest growing segments in drug development and approval. In recent years computational design techniques have achieved several successes on the design of protein binders. These novel design methodologies allow to target specific sites critical for function and to repurpose naturally occurring proteins for such applications.
