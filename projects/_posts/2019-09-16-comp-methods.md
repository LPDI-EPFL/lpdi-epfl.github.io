The Fold From Loops (FFL) algorithm was devised to fold and design functional proteins. The major strength of this algorithm, besides speed and accuracy, is the ability to generate conformational ensembles that enable an efficient search for the best amino-acid sequences to yield fully functional proteins. Our laboratory is active in the development of FFL and other algorithms.
