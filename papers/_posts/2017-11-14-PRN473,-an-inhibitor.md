# Abstract

Following inflammatory stimuli, neutrophils are recruited to sites of inflammation and exert effector functions that often have deleterious effects on tissue integrity, which can lead to organ failure. Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) is expressed in neutrophils and constitutes a promising pharmacological target for neutrophil-mediated tissue damage. Here, we evaluate a selective reversible inhibitor of Btk, PRN473, for its ability to dampen neutrophil influx via inhibition of adhesion receptor signalling pathways.
In vitro assays were used to assess fMLP receptor 1 (Fpr-1)-mediated binding of ligands to the adhesion receptors macrophage antigen-1 (Mac-1) and lymphocyte function antigen-1. Intravital microscopy of the murine cremaster was used to evaluate post-adhesion strengthening and endoluminal crawling. Finally, neutrophil influx was visualized in a clinically relevant model of sterile liver injury in vivo. Btk knockout animals were used as points of reference for Btk functions.
Pharmacological inhibition of Btk by PRN473 reduced fMLP-induced phosphorylation of Btk and Mac-1 activation. Biochemical experiments demonstrated the specificity of the inhibitor. PRN473 (20 mg·kg
