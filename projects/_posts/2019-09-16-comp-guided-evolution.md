Protein engineers have extensively used in vitro evolution techniques to alter and refine protein functionality. As any technique in vitro evolution has its own set of limitations, an important aim in at the LPDI is to develop computational algorithms that can guide in vitro evolution experiments improving its feasibility and efficiency.
