# Abstract

Methods for rapid and reliable design and structure prediction of linker loops would facilitate a variety of protein engineering applications. Circular permutation, in which the existing termini of a protein are linked by the polypeptide chain and new termini are created, is one such application that has been employed for decreasing proteolytic susceptibility and other functional purposes. The length and sequence of the linker can impact the expression level, solubility, structure and function of the permuted variants. Hence it is desirable to achieve atomic-level accuracy in linker design. Here, we describe the use of RosettaRemodel for design and structure prediction of circular permutation linkers on a model protein. A crystal structure of one of the permuted variants confirmed the accuracy of the computational prediction, where the all-atom rmsd of the linker region was 0.89 Ã… between the model and the crystal structure. This result suggests that RosettaRemodel may be generally useful for the design and structure prediction of protein loop regions for circular permutations or other structure-function manipulations.
