Welcome to the LPDI! Our group is driven by the passion of expanding natureâ€™s repertoire by designing novel functional proteins to be used for practical purposes such as therapeutics, vaccines, biosensors and others. 

The broad vision for our research is to entail several layers of characterization on our newly designed proteins: in silico, in vitro and if applicable in vivo.
