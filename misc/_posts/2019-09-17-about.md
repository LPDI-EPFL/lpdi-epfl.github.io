# Design and Implementation

We were inspired by [Dr. Allan Drummond]'s clean, elegant, and functional [site][1]. More than inspired--we have branched the code and only made some small changes and addititions.

The site uses [Jekyll Bootstrap], and is deployed using [GitHub Pages], which combines source-code control and hosting in a most pleasant way. Modify, test locally, push, and it's live.

Keeping with a major Jekyll Bootstrap idea, the site separates content and presentation. Presentation information is stored in a new theme, the `lab` theme, which may be useful to other research groups setting up sites.

By using [Sass] for stylesheets, the site gets virtually all the advantages of using [Less], while exploiting native Sass support in [GitHub Pages]. The site uses [Google Fonts] as well, primarily [Open Sans].

The site's source code is freely available on [GitHub]. All code is placed under the MIT license.
